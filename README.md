# My Portfolio - Built with Astro 

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ img/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

The `src/data` is where the remote data gathering functions are placed.

The images in `src/img` will be transformed by the Astro Image component.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

This project uses `pnpm` for package management.
